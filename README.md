Transfer Function Plotter
=========================

An  application  for  designing, manipulating and visualising the behaviour of
LTI systems based on transfer functions. Features being worked on are:

  - Manipulation:
    + Driving-Point Signal Flow Graph (DPSFG) drawing tool.
    + Standard low order filter designer (1st and 2nd order low/high/band/notch filters)
    + Butterworth filter designer
    + Chebyshev type I and II filter designer
    + Elliptic filter designer
    + Bessel filter designer
  - Visualisation
    + Frequency response (aka Bode plot)
    + Pole-Zero diagram
    + 3D Pole-Zero diagram
    + Time domain step and impulse responses

And here's what it looks like.
